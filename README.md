# Welcome, Vercelian!

If you're just getting started, go ahead and click *Use This Template -> Create New Repository* at the top of this page (<a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=vercelians-can-ship&template_owner=dddiggory">or use this shortcut</a>).
Once you've done that, we recommend the following steps: 
1. Import this repo into a <a href="https://vercel.com">new Vercel Project.</a>
2. To kick off your profile with some starter content, insert your Github Username at the top of `app/page.tsx` and Commit the change.
3. <a href="https://v0.dev">Build your own v0 Component</a>.  Paste your Component so that it overwrites `app/components/MyV0Component.tsx`.
4. The sky's the limit!! Make this your own, or start a fresh project from scratch. Think about where you'd like to take your personal website next (blog posts? a tech learning journal? a photo gallery?), then **iterate to greatness** with the help of docs, YouTube, AI, and your fellow learners.
